# E-Commerce Node

Welcome to **E-Commerce Node**! This Node.js application leverages **Express.js** for web services and **Sequelize** as the ORM to interact with a MySQL database. This guide will help you get started with setting up and running the project.

## 🚀 Getting Started

### Prerequisites

Before you start, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js** (v14.x or higher)
- **npm** (v6.x or higher)
- **MySQL** (v8.x or higher)

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/hardikwebdev/eCommerce_app_node.git
cd your-repo-name
```

### 2. Install Dependencies

```bash
npm install
```

### 3. Set Up Environment Variables

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
# Server configuration
PORT=3000

# Database configuration
DB_HOST=localhost
DB_PORT=3306
DB_NAME=your_database_name
DB_USER=your_database_user
DB_PASS=your_database_password

# Sequelize configuration
SEQUELIZE_LOGGING=false
```

### 4. Set Up the Database

Ensure MySQL is running and create your database:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE your_database_name;
```

### 5. Run the Server

Start your server:

```bash
npm start
```

The server will be available at `http://localhost:3000` (or the port specified in your `.env` file).
